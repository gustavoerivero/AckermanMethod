In the theory of computability, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest and earliest discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.
